                             _Library Status_

 Notes by: Chuck Walbourn
 Updated: June 4, 1997

 Changes for this release --------------------------------------------------

    o All instances of Flx16's have been removed and replaced with
      floating point.  Data files have been updated to have floating-point
      versions and support for old fixed-point data files has been included.

    o Lights

        - Fixed problem with multiple lights not being truly additive
        - Added ESCH_LGT_DARK dark-lights for subtractive lighting

    o FrameRef

        - rotatex/rotatey/rotatez, scale, translate, set_position, rotate,
          and pitch/roll/yaw all use incremental update of inverse
          matrix instead of compute_inverse() function.

    o Motion

        - Added motion/keyframing classes and routines created by
          Paul Masters--still need documentation for these and they
          are still under development.



 Pending changes -----------------------------------------------------------

    o Textures

        - Van Gogh will need 'handle-based' texture control with
          all management in Escher.

    o Drawable/Partitioning

        - Implement traverse
        - Implement QuadTree/BSP partitioning scheme.

    o Camera

        - Once hardware support for hazing/fogging is added to 
          Van Gogh, the EschCameraEx will need to check for this
          and disable post-process filtering.

    o Other
       
        - Other object format converters.
        - EschFireTexture may need some cleanup and updated docs.
        - EschPlosion may be rewritten or expanded.
        - EschStarfield could use a load function.
        - EschSprite may still have some rotation problems.
