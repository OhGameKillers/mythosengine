                               *** Escher Tool ***

 Notes by: Chuck Walbourn

 Last Updated: September 23, 1997

 Escher Tool - MFC Application

 Changes for this release --------------------------------------------------

 Version 2.03

    o Updated for new EschFace structure changes.

    o Added Alpha controls and interface.

    o Fixed bug with Face Properties dialog which didn't allow selection
      of faces other than the first one.

 Version 2.02

    o Updated for new EschCameraEx.



 Pending changes -----------------------------------------------------------

    o Support for 15-bit DIB mode

    o Support for full-screen mode with 3D hardware

    o The Camera, Light, and Meshes properties dialogs should enforce
      unique names for the items.

    o Handling of multiple FORMs/Scenes within an IFF file for Open/Save.



 Proposed changes ----------------------------------------------------------

    o Rename in tree view.

    o Allow import of cameras, lights, and meshes.

    o Drag in tree view to rearrange hiearchy.

    o Scripts for automatic movement of items within viewer (using application
      bits).

    o Clipboard Cut/Copy/Paste for cameras, lights, and meshes.



 Known problems ------------------------------------------------------------

    o The palette must be selected before any mesh objects are loaded or
      created to ensure proper coloring.

    o Although the Exporter outputs RGB values for the face colors of meshes, 
      the exporter sets them to the lookup value for the palette.  Therefore,
      after editing the file with Escher tool, the RGB information will be
      altered to the closest color in the palette used within the Tool, NOT
      the original RGB value from the export.

    o The output of the texture data is controlled by settings within the
      File menu and is NOT based on the input format.  The data can
      be output as 8-bit or Truecolor and either compressed or uncompressed.
      The Truecolor output uses the closest RGB values within the palette
      even if the original file was stored as Truecolor.  Also, alpha
      values will be set to 0 or 255 for transparent Truecolor output.

    o The items in the Light's Properties 'Extra' page do not disabled
      themselves when editing light objects that don't support them.  They
      are currently just ignored for those object.
