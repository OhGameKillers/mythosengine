    ° NOTE:  Due to the Unisys patent, XFileGIF will not be implemented. °

   o XFileX file-system-in-a-file class plus associated compactor and
     directory tools

   o XFParse classes will need changes to take advantage of XFileX classes,
     but they will only require that all code be recompiled.

   o XFile compression support

   o Additional XFParse bitmaps objects for new formats.
